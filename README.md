Arduino Radio Spectrum Analyzer

An application using JFreeChart that visualizes the maximum and current signal strengths
read from a serial port, from a device which measures signal strengths on the 2.4GHz band.

It is designed for a custom built 2.4GHz radio spectrum analyzer built with an Atmega328 Microcontroller and CYWM6935 radio module.
The Arduino MCU can be programmed using the CYWM6935 module, found at https://github.com/wa5znu/CYWM6935/
